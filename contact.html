            Here at Banana Transport, our team is commited to reducing vehicle carbon emissions, reducing traffic, and saving our students money. 
        We love our beautiful campus at UCSC and work to protect it. By recognizing the degration of our planet through traffic congestion,
        we work to reduce CO2 emissions and provide students with viable cheaper alternatives to transportation at the same time. 
        </p>

            Every gallon of gasoline burned creates about 8,887 grams of CO2 according to United States Environemental Protection Agency.
        As more UCSC students use Banana Transport. We reduce the daily amount of vehicles on the road; reducing our carbon emissions 
        and pushes for UCSC's goal of carbon neutrality. Reducing fossil fuel usage helps protect our beautiful campus at UCSC 
        and our planet.

            Our roads are filled with cars and traffic. Whether its just going around campus, downtown Santa Cruz, or taking the CA-17.
        You will notice the amount of cars that fill up the road. Banana Transport can reduce up to 4 extra vehicles on the road.
            </p>

            A common occurence for students is searching for rides, people to split transportation costs. By providing students with 
        designated platform for drivers and riders to match, it saves students the hassle of searching individually. These students
        can split costs of Ubers together or split the cost of gas as they travel to the same destination together.
